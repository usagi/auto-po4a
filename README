      note:
        you don't forget through the path to ~/bin

2. create a some directory and run `auto-po4a` in the directory

  e.g.)
    % mkdir /tmp/some-dir
    % cd /tmp/some-dir
    % auto-po4a

  note:
    some special scheme is enabled at the sources
      a. "null" scheme
        it's not do anything for get the get a file.
        but, afford .po generate/update and translate.
      b. "alternative" scheme
        you can use an original script as you like.
        create "bin" directory. and deply your script.
        align the script filename to source URL with a few rule:
          source: alternative://alternative/test/hoge.txt
          script: bin/alternative-test
        the script must generate ot get the "hoge.txt".
